# scrt-eth-bridge-examples


Programmatic examples of interacting with smart contract of the bridge. 

In order to support the newest testnets of Secrer Network and Ethereum and to simpify deployment process a simple version of a bridge was also implemented.
Keep noted that the bridge itself is not of production value and is triggered by POST request instead of listening to events on blckchain.
